# Hi there, I'm Amauri Santos 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with hands-on experience in creating responsive, user-friendly web applications. Until last year, I worked as a front-end developer at **Ebrai**, where I honed my skills in building efficient and scalable applications. I decided to take a break from work to focus on raising my baby, but now that my baby has turned one year old, I'm excited to get back to my coding journey and dive into new challenges.
