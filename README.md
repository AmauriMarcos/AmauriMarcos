# Hi there, I'm Amauri Santos 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with hands-on experience in creating responsive, user-friendly web applications. Until last year, I worked as a front-end developer at **Ebrai**, where I honed my skills in building efficient and scalable applications. I decided to take a break from work to focus on raising my baby 👶, but now that my baby has turned one year old, I'm excited to get back to my coding journey and dive into new challenges.
